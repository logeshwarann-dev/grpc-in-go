Protocol buffers(Protobuf):
 -> Efficient communication protocol between services
 -> Serialize & Deserialize the payload
 -> Strict Message structure
 -> Uses compression for sending large data 
 -> The data is converted into byte format for send/recieve.
 -> Better than JSON APIs
 -> Compatible with any programming language

gRPC:
 -> Remote Procedure Calls which use Protocol buffers for communication
 -> High-performance
 -> uses Http/2
